## wiki

###### this application is essentially a very basic wikipedia clone. The user can browse existing pages of encyclopedia entries. It has a very rough implementation of a search engine to look for specific articles. Users can create new pages and edit existing ones and there's an option to view a random page.

## commerce

###### the commerce app is similar to ebay, where users can list items of various categories to be auctioned off. The app uses Django models to store information inside a database. Users can browse all the available (open) auctions and bid on items they deem desirable. The owner of the auction has the ability to close the auction, making the highest bidder the winner. It's also possible to write comments on the listing page and add items to  a watchlist.

## pwee3ter

###### pwee3ter is a twitter clone in which each user has a profile that allows for making posts which will be visible to other users. Users can follow other users and like or dislike their posts. Only 10 posts will be displayed per page (pagination). The owner of the posts is able to edit them if he so pleases.
